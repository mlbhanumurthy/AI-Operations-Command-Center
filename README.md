🚀 AIOps Orchestrator

An AI-powered automation and monitoring system designed to intelligently manage IT operations, detect anomalies, and optimize resource usage across distributed environments.

This project demonstrates the integration of AI reasoning, monitoring agents, and orchestration logic to build a modular and scalable AIOps pipeline.

🌟 Key Features

Autonomous Monitoring:
Collects system metrics, logs, and service health data via modular monitors.

Intelligent Orchestration:
Uses reasoning-based decision logic to optimize workflows and recover from failures automatically.

Extensible Architecture:
Built with clear separation of modules for monitoring, orchestration, reasoning, and storage.

Configurable & Lightweight:
Designed for easy deployment and customization using Python and simple configuration files.

🚦 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AIOpsOrchestrator.git
cd AIOpsOrchestrator

2️⃣ Setup Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your environment variables if needed

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or if using uv
uv sync

4️⃣ Run the Application
python main.py

🤖 How It Works

Monitors gather operational data.

Reasoning Engine analyzes metrics for anomalies or patterns.

Orchestration Manager takes corrective actions or scales resources.

Storage Module keeps logs and state information for auditability.

🧩 Future Enhancements

Add real-time visualization dashboard

Integrate ML-based anomaly detection models

Support multi-cloud orchestration

Extend to Kubernetes environments
